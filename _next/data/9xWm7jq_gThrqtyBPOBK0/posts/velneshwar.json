This is highly recommended place if anyone is travelling via chiplun. You get amazing fish here. Fish here are generally fresh and tasty. Unfortunately, I dont have photos of fish, as everyone was hungry.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/velneshwar/hotel-abhishek.jpg\" alt=\"dinner\"></p>\n<p>We stayed at MTDC in Velneshwar. Because we arrived late, it was completely dark and we could just hear sea waves. We were hoping that the view is as good as it seemed on google photos.</p>\n<p>This was the view in the morning and it didn't disappoint.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/velneshwar/morning-view-1.jpg\" alt=\"morning-view-1\"></p>\n<p>The MTDC is located at the top of the hill and you get good view of the sea.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/velneshwar/morning-view-2.jpg\" alt=\"morning-view-2\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/velneshwar/morning-view-3.jpg\" alt=\"morning-view-3\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/velneshwar/morning-view-4.jpg\" alt=\"morning-view-4\"></p>\n<p>This is just outside of the room.\r\n<img src=\"/assets/blog/velneshwar/morning-view-5.jpg\" alt=\"morning-view-5\"></p>\n<p>We went for breakfast in MTDC hotel.
