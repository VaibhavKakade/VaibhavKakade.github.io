This trip was no expection. Velneshwar was far and it will take a lot of time reach there. We started our jounrney at around 3pm from Pune office.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/velneshwar/start.jpg" alt="start"></p>
<p>We stopped on the way to our regular place i.e Sriram wadapav. After having evening snacks, we started our journey towards Velneshwar.</p>
<p>We stopped directly in Chiplun at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/k3ns7ugrzT9yHRZg8">Hotel Abhishek</a> around 9.30pm for dinner. This is highly recommended place if anyone is travelling via chiplun. You get amazing fish here. Fish here are generally fresh and tasty. Unfortunately, I dont have photos of fish, as everyone was hungry.</p>

<p>We stayed at MTDC in Velneshwar. Because we arrived late, it was completely dark and we could just hear sea waves. We were hoping that the view is as good as it seemed on google photos.</p>
<p>This was the view in the morning and it didn't disappoint.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/velneshwar/morning-view-1.jpg" alt="morning-view-1"></p>
<p>The MTDC is located at the top of the hill and you get good view of the sea.</p>

<p>This is just outside of the room.

<p>We went for breakfast in MTDC hotel. The breakfast order was supposed to be given for all the group but one person who shall remain unnamed gave only his breakfast order. We had to give the orders all over again.

<p>After sunset, we had a dinner at a small place, which was on a platform just besides the beach.

<p>Obvious choice for dinner was fish!
